# Facebook Downloader Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete solution for downloading Facebook content (videos, reels, posts) directly from the browser using Next.js API routes and server-side parsing with Cheerio.

## How It Works

### 1. Frontend (Client-Side)

The main page (`app/page.tsx`) provides a user interface with:
- Input field for Facebook URLs
- Download button with loading indicator
- Preview of the content
- Quality selection for videos
- Automatic download trigger

### 2. Backend (Server-Side)

#### API Routes

1. **`/api/fetch`** - Parses Facebook content
   - Receives a Facebook URL
   - Uses Axios to fetch the page content
   - Uses Cheerio to parse HTML and extract:
     - Video URLs (HD/SD)
     - Images
     - Post text/content
     - Titles and descriptions
   - Returns structured data

2. **`/api/download`** - Handles file downloads
   - Receives a media URL and filename
   - Fetches the media content
   - Streams it back to the client with proper headers for download

### 3. Data Flow

1. User pastes Facebook URL and clicks "Download"
2. Frontend sends URL to `/api/fetch`
3. Backend fetches and parses Facebook page
4. Backend returns media URLs and metadata
5. Frontend displays preview and triggers download
6. Frontend requests download via `/api/download`
7. Backend fetches media and streams it back
8. Browser automatically downloads the file

## Supported Content Types

- **Videos**: Facebook videos with HD/SD quality options
- **Reels**: Short-form video content
- **Posts**: Text posts with images
- **Stories**: Coming soon (under development)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used

- `cheerio`: Server-side HTML parsing
- `axios`: HTTP requests
- `next`: React framework
- Tailwind CSS: Styling

### Key Features

- **No External Backend**: All processing happens in Next.js API routes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Multiple Languages**: Internationalization support
- **Dark/Light Theme**: User preference support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during processing

## Usage

1. Paste a Facebook URL in the input field
2. Click the "Download" button
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. The file will automatically download to your device

## Supported URL Formats

- Videos: `https://www.facebook.com/share/v/...`
- Reels: `https://www.facebook.com/share/r/...`
- Posts: `https://www.facebook.com/share/p/...`
- Stories: `https://www.facebook.com/share/s/...` (coming soon)

## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations

- User-Agent headers are set to mimic a browser
- Input validation for Facebook URLs
- Error handling for network requests
- Content-Type validation for downloads

### Performance Optimizations

- Concurrent fetching of preview and content data
- Caching of parsed results
- Efficient HTML parsing with Cheerio
- Stream-based file downloads

### Limitations

- Facebook's anti-scraping measures may affect some content
- Some private or restricted content may not be accessible
- Rate limiting may apply to frequent requests

## Testing

A test page is available at `/test` to verify functionality:
- Test Facebook URL parsing
- Verify video/image extraction
- Test download functionality

## Deployment

This implementation is designed to work with:
- Vercel (recommended)
- Netlify
- Other Next.js hosting platforms

No additional server setup is required as all functionality is contained within the Next.js application.
